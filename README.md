# CleanMyCity
This is a game focused on bridging the gap in knowledge about the Sustainable Development Goals, which was the topic for the Hackathon. It is aimed mostly at children, and provided a simple, fun way to boost their knowledge about taking care of their environment.

My contribution to the project was in the river minigame, where I worked in a pair to create the GUI and all user interactions with the minigame. It is a speed-run type minigame where the player has to collect pieces of rubbish out of the river to improve its cleanliness.
